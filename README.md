## Collection of shell completion scripts for various command line tools

Currently it contains bash and zsh completions.

* tower-cli (incomplete)
* dzil
* cpanm

The specifications for completion can be found under `specs`. They are written
in YAML and converted to shell completions with the `appspec` tool (see
https://github.com/perlpunk/App-Spec-p5 and
https://github.com/perlpunk/App-AppSpec-p5).
